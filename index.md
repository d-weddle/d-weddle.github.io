## About Me

I'm a senior at Old Dominion University with a major in applied mathematics and a minor in computer science. I'm excited to have the opportunity to take an introductory data science and analytics course at the master's level (CS 620) this semester! Options after graduation include data science, national security work, and 1-2 year teaching fellowships.
