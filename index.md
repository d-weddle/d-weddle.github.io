## About Me

I'm a senior at Old Dominion University with a major in applied mathematics and a minor in computer science. I'm excited to have the opportunity to take an introductory data science and analytics course at the master's level (CS 620) this semester! Options after graduation include data science, national security work, and 1-2 year teaching fellowships.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/d-weddle/d-weddle.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
