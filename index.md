## About

I'm a senior at Old Dominion University with a major in applied mathematics and a minor in computer science. I'm excited to have the opportunity to take an introductory data science and analytics course at the master's level (CS 620) this semester! Options after graduation include data science, national security work, and 1-2 year teaching fellowships.

## Recent Highlights

### Data / Supply Chain Analyst | Ferguson Enterprises

Summer 2021 held an excellent internship with Ferguson Enterprises focused on working with data in their supply chain division. Using SQL and Power BI, I supported S&OP within Supply Chain by streamlining KPI reporting and developing a new data visualization tool for use in safety stock analysis. The internship concluded by presenting results to supply chain senior leadership and transferring knowledge to an incoming data analyst who will be maintaining and extending the tools I developed. 

### Math / Image Processing Undergraduate Research Publication

In July 2021, the ODU Undergraduate Research Journal (*O.U.R. Journal*) published the culmination of two years of involvement in mathematical research: a paper coauthored with former visiting Ph.D. student Jianfeng Guo, titled *Fixed-Point Proximity Minimization: A Theoretical Review and Numerical Study*. Here, we exposit a minimization method put forward in a 2011 paper on image denoising and then present a numerical experiment regarding algorithm convergence when a parameter bound for theoretically guaranteed convergence is exceeded. Although not studied in this paper, the core idea in the minimization method does have applications beyond image denoising (such as in machine learning). Interested students and other scholars may access the paper [here](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/ourj/vol8/iss1/10/).
